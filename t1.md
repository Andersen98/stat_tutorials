-> # Simple Manipulations and Vectors <-

R operates on named *data structures*. The simplest is the numeric _vector_.

``` R
x <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)
```

---
-> # Simple Manipulations and Vectors <-

The function `c()` can take an arbitrary number of vector arguments
and returns a vector got by concatnating the arguments end to end. 

---
-> # Simple Manipulations and Vectors <-

The assignment operator, `<-` 'points' to the object recieving the value
of the expression. In most cases you can use the `=` operator. Assignments
can also be made using the function `assign()`.

``` R
assign("x", c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7))
```

---
-> # Simple Manipulations and Vectors <-

You can also make assignments in the other direction.

``` R
c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7) -> x
```

-> # Simple Manipulations and Vectors <-

If an expression is used as a complete commant, its value is
printed and *lost*.

``` R
1/x
```

---
-> # Simple Manipulations and Vectors <-

_Question_: What is the value stored in `y`?

``` R
x <- c(10.4,5.6,3.1,6.4,21.7)
y <- c(x, 0, x)
```

---
-> # Simple Manipulations and Vectors <-

_Answer_: y is a vector with 11 entries. It has two copies of `x` with a zero 
in the middle

``` R
x <- c(10.4,5.6,3.1,6.4,21.7)
y <- c(x, 0, x)
```

---
-> # Vector Arithmetic <-

Vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Vectors in an expression don't have
to be the same length. If that is the case, the value of the expression is a
vector of the same length as the larges vector. Smaller vectors are _recycled_ as
much as necessary until its size matches.

---
-> # Vector Arithmetic <-

Here, `2*x` is repeated 2.2 times, `y` is repeated 1 time, and 1 is repeated 11 times. 

``` R
x <- c(10.4,5.6,3.1,6.4,21.7)
y <- c(x, 0, x)
v <- 2*x + y +1
```
