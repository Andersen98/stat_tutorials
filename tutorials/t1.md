-> Basics of R <-

-------------------------------------------------

-> # Getting R on your system <-

This tutorial is best done if you follow along on
your own system. Make sure to download R if you have
not already.


-------------------------------------------------

-> # Getting R on your system <-

**Mac and Windows**:
- select a mirror from [cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
- select either the Mac or Windows option depending on your system
- follow the installer instructions



-------------------------------------------------

-> # Getting R on your system <-

**Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora (and most other distributions)**:
Download R from your package manager (ex: apt,rpm,pacman etc.. )

``` bash
sudo apt-get install r-base r-recommended
```
``` bash
sudo dnf install R
```

``` bash
sudo pacman -S r
```
-------------------------------------------------

-> # Setting up a front end <-

From the arch linux wiki:
> R does not include a point-and-click graphical user 
interface for statistics or data manipulation. However
, third-party user interfaces for R are available, 
such as R Commander and Rattle.

-------------------------------------------------

-> # Setting up a front end <-

For little fuss, I'd reccomend RStudio!
posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

(although I reccomend exploring other front ends)


-------------------------------------------------

# ->  What is R? <-

From the R FAQ:y
> R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. 
It consists of a language plus a run-time environment 
with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions,
 and the ability to run programs stored in script files.
