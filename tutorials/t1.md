 Basics of R 

-------------------------------------------------

 # Getting R on your system 

This tutorial is best done if you follow along on
your own system. Make sure to download R if you have
not already.


-------------------------------------------------

 # Getting R on your system 

**Mac and Windows**:
- select a mirror from [cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
- select either the Mac or Windows option depending on your system
- follow the installer instructions



-------------------------------------------------

 # Getting R on your system 

**Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora (and most other distributions)**:
Download R from your package manager (ex: apt,rpm,pacman etc.. )

``` bash
sudo apt-get install r-base r-recommended
```
``` bash
sudo dnf install R
```

``` bash
sudo pacman -S r
```
-------------------------------------------------

 # Setting up a front end 

From the arch linux wiki:
> R does not include a point-and-click graphical user 
interface for statistics or data manipulation. However
, third-party user interfaces for R are available, 
such as R Commander and Rattle.

-------------------------------------------------

 # Setting up a front end 

For little fuss, I'd reccomend RStudio!
posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

(although I reccomend exploring other front ends)


-------------------------------------------------

#   What is R? 

From the R FAQ:y
> R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. 
It consists of a language plus a run-time environment 
with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions,
 and the ability to run programs stored in script files.

# intro to R

 # Simple Manipulations and Vectors 

R operates on named *data structures*. The simplest is the numeric _vector_.

``` R
x <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)
```

---------------------------------------------------

 # Simple Manipulations and Vectors 

The function `c()` can take an arbitrary number of vector arguments
and returns a vector got by concatnating the arguments end to end. 

---------------------------------------------------

  # Simple Manipulations and Vectors 

The assignment operator, `` 'points' to the object recieving the value
of the expression. In most cases you can use the `=` operator. Assignments
can also be made using the function `assign()`.

``` R
assign("x", c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7))
```

---------------------------------------------------

 # Simple Manipulations and Vectors 

You can also make assignments in the other direction.

``` R
c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)->  x
```

---------------------------------------------------

 # Simple Manipulations and Vectors 

If an expression is used as a complete commant, its value is
printed and *lost*.

``` R
1/x
```

---------------------------------------------------

 # Simple Manipulations and Vectors 

If an expression is used as a complete commant, its value is
printed and *lost*.

``` R
1/x
```
```
 > 1/x
[1] 0.09615385 0.17857143 0.32258065 0.15625000 0.04608295
```

---------------------------------------------------

  # Simple Manipulations and Vectors 

_Question_: What is the value stored in `y`?

``` R
x <- c(10.4,5.6,3.1,6.4,21.7)
y <- c(x, 0, x)
```

---------------------------------------------------
 
 # Simple Manipulations and Vectors 

**Answer**: y is a vector with 11 entries. It has two copies of `x` with a zero 
in the middle

``` R
x <- c(10.4,5.6,3.1,6.4,21.7)
y <- c(x, 0, x)
```
```
 > y
 [1] 10.4  5.6  3.1  6.4 21.7  0.0 10.4  5.6  3.1  6.4 21.7
> 
```
---------------------------------------------------
 
 # Vector Arithmetic 

Vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Vectors in an expression don't have
to be the same length. If that is the case, the value of the expression is a
vector of the same length as the larges vector. Smaller vectors are _recycled_ as
much as necessary until its size matches.

---------------------------------------------------
 
 # Vector Arithmetic 

Here, `2*x` is repeated 2.2 times, `y` is repeated 1 time, and 1 is repeated 11 times. 

``` R
x <- c(10.4,5.6,3.1,6.4,21.7)
y <- c(x, 0, x)
v <- 2*x + y +1
```
